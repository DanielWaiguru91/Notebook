# Notebook
A note keeping app to help users manage their notes and tasks neatly and easily

I used the following components in development
* Room to store user notes and/ tasks
* LiveData to handle apps data in lifecycle aware fashion
* ViewModel to manage UI's data in lifecycle aware manners

#### User Interface
##### All Notes/Tasks Screen
